zathura - a document viewer
===========================
zathura is a highly customizable and functional document viewer based on the
girara user interface library and several document libraries.

Requirements
------------
gtk3
glib (>= 2.28)
girara (>= 0.1.8)
sqlite3 (optional, >= 3.5.9)
check (for tests)
intltool
python-docutils (optional, for man pages)
libmagic from file(1) (optional, for mime-type detection)

Please note that you need to have a working pkg-config installation and that the
Makefile is only compatible with GNU make. If you don't have a working
pkg-config installation please set the GTK_INC, GTK_LIB, GIRARA_INC, GIRARA_LIB,
SQLITE_INC and SQLITE_LIB variables accordingly.

And also note that rst2man from python-docutils is needed to build the man pages.
If it is not installed, the man pages won't be built.

If you don't want to build with support for sqlite databases, you can set
WITH_SQLITE=0 and sqlite support won't be available.

The use of magic to detect mime types is optional and can be disabled by setting
WITH_MAGIC=0.

If you pass these flags as a command line argument to make, you have to ensure
to pass the same flags when executing the install target.

Installation
------------
To build and install zathura:

  make install

Uninstall
---------
To delete zathura from your system, just type:

  make uninstall
