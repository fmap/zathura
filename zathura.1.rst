CONFIGURATION
=============
The default appearance and behaviour of zathura can be overwritten by modifying
the *zathurarc* file (default path: ~/.config/zathura/zathurarc). For a detailed
description please consult zathurarc(5).

SYNCTEX SUPPORT
===============
Both synctex forward and backwards synchronization are supported by zathura, To
enable synctex forward synchronization, please look at the *--syntex* and
*--synctex-editor* options. To support synctex backwards synchronization,
zathura provides a D-Bus interface that can be called by the editor. For
convince zathura also knows how to parse the output of the *synctex view*
command. It is enough to pass the arguments to *synctex view*'s *-i* option to
zathura via *--syntex-forward* and zathura will pass the information to the
correct instance.

KNOWN BUGS
==========
If GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS is enabled you will experience problems with large
documents. In this case zathura might crash or pages cannot be rendered
properly. Disabling GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS fixes this issue.
